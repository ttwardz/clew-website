            <h2>Clew 1.0.6 Update</h2>
            <div class="post-date">May 2, 2025</div>
            <p>Clew 1.0.6 brings the following enhancements:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>WIDGET CUSTOMIZATION: Personalize your home screen and lock screen widgets with font styles, text color, background color, and more. With widget themes, each of your widgets can have a different style.</li>
            <li>BACKUP AND RESTORE get new features: Your complete database is already backed up automatically once per day. You can also manually back up at any time. Now, it's easier than ever to completely restore from a backup. Or, choose Compare with Backup to compare your current data with any backup so that you can easily restore specific items if you accidentally deleted something.</li>
            <li>BETTER SCANNER: The scanner continues to improve, with better handling of paragraph breaks and punctuation.</li>
            <li>ACCESSIBILITY: The app's UI components are now more accessible with VoiceOver.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>More improvements:</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>The add highlight button is now conveniently visible on all views.</li>
            <li>Widgets are more interactive - you can tap a book title or author name to quickly open that page.</li>
            <li>You can filter highlights by untagged or tagged only, in addition to showing all.</li>
            <li>The web search for autofilling new book information has better, more comprehensive results from multiple sources. It also now uses a work's original publication year instead of the specific edition's publication year.</li>
            <li>When editing a highlight, tapping Add Note will automatically focus the note text editor, and tapping Add Tags will automatically show the select tags sheet.</li>
            <li>The plus (+) button on widgets is optional now. You can add/remove it by tapping and holding on a widget and choosing Edit Widget.</li>
            <li>There's a new, convenient Add Source button when you're viewing a highlight that doesn't have one yet.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="post-date">May 2, 2025</div>
            <p>Clew 1.0.3 brings a few new features and enhancements. There's a  new scanner button, which you can use to quickly snap a photo of a book page or document and select the text you want to add as a highlight. The scanner will conveniently separate it into paragraphs or sentences.</p>

            <p>You can also now sort books by their number of highlights.</p>

            <h2>Clew 1.0 Launch</h2>
            <div class="post-date">April 7, 2025</div>
            <p>After 12 TestFlight builds and 4 years of development, Clew is live on the App Store and available to download for free.</p>
            <blockquote>
                "Clew was born from a simple idea&mdash;what if your highlights, thoughts, and margin notes could follow you anywhere, across all your books and media, rather than be trapped in individual apps and platforms?"
            </blockquote>
            <p>Thank you to all the beta testers who helped make this possible! Your feedback and suggestions have been instrumental in creating version 1.0 and directing where Clew will go in the future.</p>
