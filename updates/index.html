                <p>The Clew app just got even better! Here's what's new.</p>
                <h3>New features:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>I've added a tip jar! If you love using Clew, you can show your support with a selection of tip
                        options in settings.</li>
                    <li>Fix: The Share extension now properly shows a webpage's title instead of arbitrary numbers.</li>
                    <li>Fix: Recently created and selected sources now appear for quick selection when creating a
                        highlight. You can customize the number of items to show in settings.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Clew 1.2 Update</h2>
                <div class="post-date">November 7, 2025</div>
                <p>My collection in Clew has more than 1,000 highlights at this point, and I noticed that a previous change had made navigating around the app weirdly slow and laggy, especially with large collections. So, I fixed that, and now the app is snappy and buttery smooth to use again!</p>
                <h3>New features:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Share Highlights: Quickly share your
                        highlights as text or Markdown to friends
                        and other apps.</li>
                    <li>Shortcuts Integration: Create
                        highlights via the iOS Shortcuts app and
                        Siri and images. Much more to come!</li>
                    <li>Huge performance improvements: Even
                        with thousands of items in your
                        collection, lists and detail views will
                        load quickly, scroll smoothly, and respond
                        instantly.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Other improvements:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fixed potential sync issue between
                        devices.</li>
                    <li>Better grouped views for browsing
                        your content by people, websites, and
                        albums.</li>
                    <li>Scanner improvements, with better
                        paragraph detection, margin handling, and
                        smart hyphen removal.</li>
                    <li>Quick navigation menus in detail
                        views so that you can jump from a detail
                        view to another list view right from the
                        top menu bar.</li>
                    <li>Smart image quality enhancement
                        system.</li>
                    <li>Better author/artist management with
                        auto-matching and creation.</li>
                    <li>Year published sort option for
                        books.</li>
                    <li>Selectable ISBN on book
                        details.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Get ready, because your Clew experience is about to change in big ways this fall.</p>

                        and web pages, you can now use songs as

                        the album artwork along with artist
                        information, and you can even group songs

                <h3>Even more improvements:</h3>

                <h2>Clew 1.0.6 Update</h2>
                <div class="post-date">May 2, 2025</div>
                <p>Clew 1.0.6 brings the following enhancements:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>WIDGET CUSTOMIZATION: Personalize your home screen and lock screen widgets with font styles,
                        text color, background color, and more. With widget themes, each of your widgets can have a
                        different style.</li>
                    <li>BACKUP AND RESTORE get new features: Your complete database is already backed up automatically
                        once per day. You can also manually back up at any time. Now, it's easier than ever to
                        completely restore from a backup. Or, choose Compare with Backup to compare your current data
                        with any backup so that you can easily restore specific items if you accidentally deleted
                        something.</li>
                    <li>BETTER SCANNER: The scanner continues to improve, with better handling of paragraph breaks and
                        punctuation.</li>
                    <li>ACCESSIBILITY: The app's UI components are now more accessible with VoiceOver.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>More improvements:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The add highlight button is now conveniently visible on all views.</li>
                    <li>Widgets are more interactive - you can tap a book title or author name to quickly open that
                        page.</li>
                    <li>You can filter highlights by untagged or tagged only, in addition to showing all.</li>
                    <li>The web search for autofilling new book information has better, more comprehensive results from
                        multiple sources. It also now uses a work's original publication year instead of the specific
                        edition's publication year.</li>
                    <li>When editing a highlight, tapping Add Note will automatically focus the note text editor, and
                        tapping Add Tags will automatically show the select tags sheet.</li>
                    <li>The plus (+) button on widgets is optional now. You can add/remove it by tapping and holding on
                        a widget and choosing Edit Widget.</li>
                    <li>There's a new, convenient Add Source button when you're viewing a highlight that doesn't have
                        one yet.</li>

                <div class="post-date">May 2, 2025</div>
                <p>Clew 1.0.3 brings a few new features and enhancements. There's a new scanner button, which you can
                    use to quickly snap a photo of a book page or document and select the text you want to add as a
                    highlight. The scanner will conveniently separate it into paragraphs or sentences.</p>
                <p>When you scan a book page, Clew now looks for the title, author, and page number in the margins and
                    automatically applies that information to the new highlight or suggests book options if it finds
                    multiple matches in your library.</p>
                <p>You can also now sort books by their number of highlights.</p>

                <div class="post-date">April 7, 2025</div>
                <p>After 12 TestFlight builds and 4 years of development, Clew is live on the App Store and available to
                    download for free.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    "Clew was born from a simple idea&mdash;what if your highlights, thoughts, and margin notes could
                    follow you anywhere, across all your books and media, rather than be trapped in individual apps and
                    platforms?"
                </blockquote>
                <p>Thank you to all the beta testers who helped make this possible! Your feedback and suggestions have
                    been instrumental in creating version 1.0 and directing where Clew will go in the future.</p>
