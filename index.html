Coming soon to all my friends who love to read...

Who love writing notes in the margins and underlining text but hate watching their notes disappear as soon as they close the book...

This is the app you've been waiting for. A single place for all your reading highlights, notes, and favorite passages.

Save 'em, tag 'em, search 'em, share 'em... and watch as you start finding connections and noticing patterns across books, authors, websites, decades, centuries, countries, languages, genres, and more.

This is your new favorite place to store, sort, and share clippings all your favorite media, whether it's a mind-blowing plot twist in a novel, a hilarious quote in a movie, a devastating song lyric, a grand discovery in an online article, or simply a quirky adjective 

This is Clew.
