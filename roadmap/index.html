            <h2>Coming Soon to Clew</h2>
            <p>Here's a list of features in the works for upcoming updates:</p>
            <ul class="feature-list">
                <li>More source types: in addition to books, webpages, and music, you'll be able to add movies, TV shows, podcasts, and more.</li>
                <li>Even faster highlight creation, with a better scanner, a bulk-scanning option, intelligent tag suggestions, and smart context.</li>
                <li>Save highlights directly from a wider variety of apps, like Books, Kindle, Serial Reader, and more.</li>
                <li>Link to other highlights, books, authors, and more to build links between similar items.</li>
                <li>Create and manage custom Collections.</li>
                <li>Lots more...</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Have a Feature Request?</h2>
            <p>I'm always looking for ways to improve Clew. If you have a feature you'd like to see, let me know!</p>
            <a href="mailto:help@getclew.com?subject=Clew%20Feature%20Request" class="cta-button">Suggest a Feature</a>

        <div class="ios-card">
            <h2>Pricing</h2>
            <p>Clew is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/clew-highlights-and-notes/id6477902274">free to download</a>, and the core features of the app as it is in version 1.0 will remain free.</p>
						<p>However, Clew is not free to develop and maintain for me (yep, it's just one person building this app). So, in the future, some advanced features will require an affordable subscription fee.</p>
						<p>I hope you'll see the value in this app and choose to support its development.</p>
